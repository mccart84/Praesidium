                    Teachers are some of the most influential people on today’s youth. In the early parts of their life, kids spend a majority of their time at
                    school. These young kids are also the most vulnerable to human trafficking
                    because they do not know any better and they physically cannot do much against an attacker. In order to educate our youth, 
                    it is important for teachers to be fully aware of the dangers of human trafficking 
                    and the signs of a possible attack. This page contains information and resources that
                    will give content to our educators so that they can learn and pass on the information to their students.
